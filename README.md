A Simpe Port Knocking Script Using nc (netcat) to check for open ports.

 I wrote a minimalistic script that uses nc (netcat) to knock ports.

 So, now you dont need to scan the entire range with nmap.

 Instead, just find the open ports and scan those :) 

 The script details how to use it.

 Hope you guys like it.
